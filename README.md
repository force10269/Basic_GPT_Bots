Note: This README.md was generated by the GPT-4 model :)

This repository contains two Discord bots that demonstrate the use of GPT models:

1. GPT-Bot: A bot that generates responses using the GPT model.
2. Tiktoken-Bot: A bot that counts tokens for different GPT models.

## Setup

### Discord Developer Portal

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and sign in.
2. Click on "New Application" and provide a name for your application.
3. Go to the "Bot" tab on the left side and click "Add Bot" to create a new bot.
4. Copy the bot token and save it for later use.

### .env files

Create a `.env` file for each bot using the provided `.env.sample` files in their respective folders:

GPT-Bot:

```txt
GPT_API_KEY=<your_gpt_api_key>
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=<your_discord_bot_token>
```

Tiktoken-Bot:

```txt
BOT_TOKEN=<your_discord_bot_token>
```

In these, you should replace `<your_gpt_api_key>` and `<your_discord_bot_token>` with your actual API key and Discord bot token.

### Python Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3.7 or newer installed. Then, install the required Python packages by running:

- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running the Bots

To start each bot, navigate to their respective folders and run their Python scripts:

GPT-Bot:

- `python gpt_bot.py`

Tiktoken-Bot:

- `python tiktoken_bot.py`

## Bot Commands
# GPT-Bot
- `!gpt <prompt>`: Generates a response based on the given prompt using the GPT model

# Tiktoken-Bot
- `!count <model_name>`: Counts the number of tokens in the message content or any attached text files or images for the specified GPT model

### Disclaimer
These bots are for demonstration purposes only. They may not be suitable for use in a production environment without further optimization and error handling.
